# Speech Synthesis and Perception with Envelope Cues

## Overview
This project investigates how spectral envelope cues—specifically the number of vocoder bands—affect the intelligibility of noisy speech. We generate a speech‑shaped noise (SSN) mixture, apply a low‑pass filter, and then synthesize the signal using a tone‑vocoder with varying channel counts. By comparing time‑ and frequency‑domain representations, as well as listening tests, we quantify how increasing spectral resolution restores intelligible speech.

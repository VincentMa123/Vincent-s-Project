# Motion Detection Via Communication Signal

## Overview
This MATLAB project leverages existing wireless communication signals (e.g., Wi‑Fi, Bluetooth) to perform motion detection without specialized radar hardware. By computing the ambiguity function (a 2D delay–Doppler correlation map) on sequential signal segments and converting the results to a decibel‑scaled Range‑Doppler spectrum, it visualizes how moving objects affect signal reflections over time.

**Prerequisites**
- MATLAB R2018b or later
- Signal Processing Toolbox
